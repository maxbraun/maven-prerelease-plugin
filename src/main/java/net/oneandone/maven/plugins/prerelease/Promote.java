/**
 * Promotes a prerelease by commuting the tag and deploying its artifact(s).
 *
 * Execute this goal in the svn working directory of the project you want to release and make sure you have created a prerelease.
 *
 * This goal commits the tag of the current prerelease and deploys the respective artifact(s). It also updates (in your svn trunk or branch
 * on the svn server) the project version in pom.xml to the next development version, and it updates your changes file (if you have one).
 * In your svn working directory, it runs "svn up" to get the adjusted pom and changes files.
 *
 * Artifacts are deployed by invoking all plugin goals tied to the deploy phase. These goals are either mandatory or optional, as configured
 * by the "mandatory" parameter. Mandatory goals have to succeed for this plugin to succeed. Optional goals may fail, which results in a
 * warning only. The maven-deploy plugin is typically (and by default) mandatory, other notification goals are optional.
 *
 * Error handling. In contrast to Maven's Release Plugin there's no rollback goal: when promote fails, artifacts and tags will be properly
 * removed. (If Tag creation fails, this goal fails with an error. If artifact deployment fails, the svn tag will be deleted from
 * the repository and the goal fails with an error. If optional promote goal fail, the plugins succeeds, but it issues a warning.)
 *
 * Note that the deployment date of artifacts in the repository may be later that the release date in the changes.xml.
